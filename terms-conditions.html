              <h2>Employing our Services</h2>
              <p>In order to enter into a contract to employ our services conventionally, you will need to take the following steps:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Select a template that you believe can be re-designed by our developers to fit the design vision of your website, and then request a quote. The ability to request a quote is indicated clearly by a labelled button on the template webpage.</li>
                <li>Requesting a quote entails contacting us (the avenue of contacting us is arranged by clicking the ‘request a quote’ button) and filling out the prompts requested. Messages for a quote request preferably include a description of your business, vision for your website, modifications you would like to make and if you would like to interchange our provided templates. We require this information to measure a suitable price for our services.</li>
                <li>To send this information, you must also agree to these terms of use and ensure any information you provided to us has not violated these terms of use.</li>
                <li>We will then show you initial acknowledgement that your request has been sent and received</li>
                <li>Once we have checked whether we are able to meet your request, we will either send you confirmation via email or phone (preferred method of contact can also be listed in the message) as well as an estimated fee for our services, and explain next steps (at which point your order will become a binding contract via these terms of use) or we will confirm that we are unable to meet your order.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Before you send your quote request, you will have the opportunity of identifying whether you have made any errors by reviewing your request before you click ‘Submit Inquiry’. You may correct those errors before submitting your request. In any event, you may also correct yourself in further communication with us once we contact you about your quote.</p>
              <p>The price you receive as a quote is a rough estimate, the end payment being relative to how much less or extra design requests you request for us to implement. We do our best to ensure accuracy of our prices, and in many cases the price you pay will be the same or very similar to the price we gave you in our initial quote. We price our services based on the current market value of the services we provide and how much modification and work is required to complete your order.</p>
              <p>All of our prices are provided in $CAD (Canadian Dollars), unless otherwise indicated. Flat fees / prices for products are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect contracts which have already come into force.</p>

              <h2>Paying for our Services</h2>
              <p>Our product range consists of web development and search engine optimization services, which can only be downloaded, viewed and accessed digitally. Oriplex does not sell any physical products.</p>
              <p>Oriplex offers websites (our primary Product) through .zip folders containing the necessary files, stylesheets, scripts, etc. to operate your website. Although Oriplex also offers services to set up, maintain and set up hosting of your website on a domain of your choosing, should you not want these services, ensure you have means of uploading, using and accessing your websites in the way you want to. We are not responsible if you decline our offer to set up and maintain your website and then cannot do so yourself to your liking.</p>
              <p>Services on our website are paid for via a range of payment options, including <strong>e-transfer</strong>, <strong>direct deposit</strong>, and payment gateways such as <strong>PayPal</strong>. Ensure you are able to pay us via one of the three aforementioned methods when requested in accordance with our payment structure outlined in the next paragraph. If you do not satisfy the legal requirements to order our services or to pay for them, please do not attempt to do so. We are not liable for any repercussions you may receive should you not satisfy legal requirements to pay for our services. Should we find out you do not, we will decline your order.</p>
              <p>Our payment structure goes as so:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>We request <strong>one-half</strong> (½), or 50%, of the agreed price for the website after you are satisfied with a website mockup your Oriplex web developer that will be in contact with you throughout the process sends. Your developer will ask you your preferred method of payment and arrange to provide you the information required.</li>
                <li>Upon confirmation we will stay in contact with you during the construction of the site, which may take 1 - 2 weeks depending on time of year, developer availability, etc. You will receive an estimated time to completion from your developer.</li>
                <li>Once we complete your website (the Order), should you be satisfied with the final product, we will request final payment of the last ½ of the price of the site. Once received, <strong>should you decline our care package offer</strong> to setup and maintain your site, once you are provided the .zip file with your website, we are not responsible nor liable for any modifications made, or any errors induced as a cause of modification by yourself or any third-party you have granted access to the file we provided you with. Should you accept our offer to set-up hosting and continue to maintain your website (or any combination of the three), and make the payment arrangements (we offer these services in recurring subscription packages), we accept responsibility for the following things:</li>
                <li><strong>Should you purchase a package that offers hosting set up:</strong> We accept responsibility for bringing the site online. You may give us a hosting provider of your choice, but we recommend the hosting provider ‘Hostinger’. Current up-time statistics for websites hosted by ‘Hostinger’, are 99.9% up-time.</li>
                <li>Additionally, we accept responsibility for the safe and uncorrupted transfer of data from the file we provided to a domain host of your choice, and we also accept responsibility for a working, publicly accessible site as the end result.</li>
                <li>Should there be complications regarding arrangements you, as a client, were responsible for making, we are not liable for not meeting the “end result” mentioned in the previous bullet point. Arrangements made should be a hosting service you have paid for, and a domain you have paid for, unless you requested the former service from us. We are not responsible for purchasing you a domain.</li>
                <li><strong>Should you purchase a package that offers regular site maintenance and updating:</strong> We will continue to maintain it at your request in line with our subscription package, where you can learn more about <a href=”https://oriplex.com#pricing-scroll”>here</a> or in Section 09 of these terms.</li>
                <li>We accept responsibility for any modifications made with an end result not to your liking, and responsibility for modifications resulting in the violation of our terms of use, the hosting provider’s terms of use or your request. Should modifications be made by us resulting in that, the developer (one of our staff who modified the site) shall be suspended and the issue shall be rectified.</li>
                <li>We are not liable for any modifications made by a third-party that is not endorsed by us or we were not informed about.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Oriplex stores copies of every website we have completed. Should you need the original .zip file of your site as a client, email <a href=”#contact-footer”>info@oriplex.com</a> with the subject header: Original .zip file request, proceeded by your name or the name of your business. Should you not want us to store your original .zip file, please email <a href=”#contact-footer”>info@oriplex.com</a> with the subject header: Website file & data removal, followed by your name or the name of your business. We will then take the necessary steps to eliminate your website file from our databases.</p>
              <p>We currently do not offer payment via credit card or debit card on our website, but look forward to adding the feature in the near future.</p>
              <p>When paying for our services at any time, you warrant to us:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts, and you have full authority, power and capacity to agree to these terms of sale / terms of use;</li>

                <li>when providing payment information (including PIN, Key or account information) that you have the authority to authorize our chosen third party payment processors to process your payment or the authority to authorize your banking service to effect payment to us.</li>

              <h2>Payment Disputes, Refunds & Chargebacks</h2>
              <p>Payment must be made in line with our payment structure outlined in Section 07 of these terms of use. We may withhold the products and/or cancel the contract between us if the price is not received from you in full in cleared funds when requested.</p>
              <p>Due to our developer policy of striving to create a website perfect for the client, we offer chances to inspect the product, it’s features and functionality before having the client provide payment and delivering the final product. Refunds will not be issued due to your dissatisfaction with the final product after final payment and delivery, or if you cannot manage to set up, maintain or host the site and you declined Oriplex’s offer to do so for you.</p>
              <p>In any other event, if you believe you qualify for a refund for reasons other than the aforementioned, please contact Oriplex through email at <a href=”#contact-footer”>info@oriplex.com</a> with the subject header: Refund Request - followed by your name or your company’s name.</p>
              <p>If you wish to dispute any payment made to us you must contact us immediately and provide full details of your claim. If you submit an unjustified credit card, debit card or other charge-back then you will be liable to pay us, within 7 days following the date of the charge-back: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>an amount equal to the amount of the charge-back;</li>
                <li>all third party expenses incurred by us in relation to the charge-back (including charges made by our or your bank or payment processor or card issuer);</li>
                <li>all our reasonable costs, losses and expenses incurred in recovering the amounts referred to in this paragraph (including without limitation legal fees and debt collection fees), and;</li>
                <li>an administration fee of CAD 30</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Without prejudice to our other rights, if you submit an unjustified credit card, debit card or other charge-back, then we may terminate any contracts between you and us under these terms of sale by giving you <strong>written notice of termination.</strong></p>
              <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if you fail to recognise or fail to remember the source of an entry on your card statement or other financial statement, and make a charge-back as a result, this will constitute an unjustified charge-back.</p>

              <h2>Subscription Based Care Packages</h2>
              <p>As mentioned in these terms & conditions multiple times, and on our website, Oriplex offers ‘care packages’ in two different tiers that include services such as initial hosting set-up (if you bought a website from us), site maintenance, better search engine optimization, security review, content updates (text/images/videos), and more.</p>
              <p>These care packages require a monthly payment with a figure determined based on what tier you select. Monthly payments can be made at a mutually agreed upon date (between your Oriplex developer and yourself), or automatically through one of our third party payment processors. Unfortunately, we currently do not offer automatic payment as we don’t employ a third party payment processor.</p>
              <p>Paying for a care package will require us to have access to the email you own that is registered to the website hosting provider of your choice, so we can make changes within the hosting service’s panel. If you bought a website from us without ever owning a domain before, we do offer services to set up that email and give over access to you.</p>
