        <p>If you own a business, regardless of the size, web hosting is no longer an option; it`s a necessity. Online searching is the norm nowadays, so your business needs a reliable and accessible website for potential clients to find. Gone are the days when businesses were listed in yellow pages; if you can`t be found in a search engine, your business doesn`t exist. Businesses need a sharable website to build an online presence. Without a website, your business lacks discoverability, and will earn little money. Granted, web hosting isn`t exclusively a business investment; if you`re aiming to host a personal site, blog, or project, hosting services are also highly valuable.</p>
        <p>In order to help you find the best web hosting for your needs we have compiled the top 4 providers.

        <p>Bluehost makes sense for most small and medium businesses searching for hosting because of its managed WordPress hosting options and excellent 24x7 live chat assistance from seasoned specialists. Most businesses will also benefit from Blue Sky, an add-on service that offers specialised assistance in SEO, mobile optimization, and other areas to help you get the most out of your WordPress installation. Bluehost's shared hosting plans are all run on AMD servers with 2GB of RAM. You receive at least 50GB of storage space and a variety of functions, while automatic backups are only available on premium subscriptions. You'll love the point-and-click website builder if you need assistance putting your website together.</p>
